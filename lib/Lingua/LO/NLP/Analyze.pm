=head1 NAME

Lingua::LO::NLP::Analyze - Analyze a Lao syllable and provide accessors to its constituents

=head1 FUNCTION

Objects of this class represent a Lao syllable with an analysis of its
constituents. After passing a valid syllable to the constructor, the parts are
available via accessor methods as outlined below.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

C<new( $syllable, %options )>

The constructor takes a syllable and any number of options as hash-style
arguments. The only option specified so far is C<normalize>, a boolean value
indicating whether to run the syllable through tone mark normalization (see
L<Lingua::LO::NLP::Data/normalize_tone_marks>). It does not fail but may
produce nonsense if the argument is not valid according to Lao morphology
rules.

=head2 ACCESSORS


=head3 syllable

The original syllable as used by the parser. This may be subtly different from
the one passed to the constructor:

=over 4

=item

If the C<normalize> option was set, tone marks and vowels may have been reordered

=item

If the decomposed form of LAO VOWEL SIGN AM (◌າ) is used, it will have been
converted to the composed form

=item

Combinations of ຫ with ລ, ມ or ນ will have been converted to the combined characters.

=back

=head3 parse

A hash of raw constituents as returned by the parsing regexp. Although the
other accessors present constituents in a more accessible way and take care of
morphological special cases like the treatment of ຫ, this may come in handy to
quickly check e.g. if there was a vowel component before the core consonant.

=head3 vowel

The syllable's vowel or diphthong. As the majority of vowels have more than one
code point, the consonant position is represented by the Unicode character
designated for this function, DOTTED CIRCLE or U+25CC.

=head3 consonant

The syllable's core consonant

=head3 end_consonant

The end consonant if present, C<undef> otherwise.

=head3 tone_mark

The tone mark if present, C<undef> otherwise.

=head3 semivowel

The semivowel following the core consonant if present, C<undef> otherwise.

=head3 h

"ຫ" if the syllable contained a combining ຫ, i.e. one that isn't the core consonant.

=head3 vowel_length

The string 'long' or 'short'.

=head3 live

Boolean indicating whether this is a "live" or a "dead" syllable. Dead
syllables end in a short vowel or stopped consonant (ກ, ດ or ບ), lives ones end
in a long vowel, diphthong, semivowel or nasal consonant. This is used for tone
determination but also available as an attribute, just in case it might be
useful. C<true> indicates a live syllable.

=head3 tone

One of the following strings, depending on core consonant class, vowel length and tone mark:

=over 4

=item LOW_RISING

=item LOW

=item HIGH

=item MID_FALLING

=item HIGH_FALLING

=item MID_STOP

=item HIGH_STOP

=back

The latter two occur with short vowels, the other ones with long vowels.
