v0.3.0
	* BUGFIX: completely reworked the seriously broken tone rules.
		Despite each Lao material using its own, slightly different
		scheme, this should come close to reality now.
v0.2.0
	* BUGFIX: add missing diphthongs ເ◌ີຍ and ເ◌ິຍ
	* BUGFIX: Lingua::LO::NLP::Romanize::hyphen did not allow
		to turn off hyphenation with an undef value as that
		makes it act as a read accessor. Now you can
		pass an explicit 0.
	* IMPROVEMENT: split ວ => ʋ/w depending on position in IPA
	* IMPROVEMENT: small documentation enhancements
