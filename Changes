v1.0.3  2017-11-14
	* BUGFIX: fixed regression in v1.0.2 that broke vowel Xວ

v1.0.2  2017-11-13
	* BUGFIX: fixed two IPA transcriptions:
	  * ຫວ as a core consonant is ʋ (was w)
	  * Xອຍ was incorrectly transliterated as oːi, changed to ɔːi
	* IMPROVEMENT: simplified consonant tables in the IPA module by
	  removing some bogus (though harmless as they were never used) entries.

v1.0.1  2017-10-03
	* BUGFIX: remove /n/ as final-position pronunciation of ລ/ຣ
	* BUGFIX: remove useless/misspelled vowel Xັວ
	* IMPROVEMENT: LLONLP::Romanize::romanize_syllable() accepts an
		analysis result from LLONLP::Analyze now, for significant
		savings when you need both analysis and romanization.
	* IMPROVEMENT: add glottal stop symbol in IPA for ະ
	* IMPROVEMENT: small regexp optimization

v1.0.0  2017-07-30
	* BUGFIX: LAO VOWEL SIGN AM was "normalized" to the wrong character
		order when used after a tone mark.
	* BUGFIX: completely reworked the seriously broken tone rules.
		Despite each Lao material using its own, slightly different
		scheme, this should come close to reality now. This entails a
		set of tones that is slightly different from v0.2.0
	* IMPROVEMENT: Lingua::LO::NLP now accepts constructor options (one,
	  actually) to use as defaults for other methods.

v0.2.0  2017-02-28
	* BUGFIX: add missing diphthongs ເ◌ີຍ and ເ◌ິຍ
	* BUGFIX: Lingua::LO::NLP::Romanize::hyphen did not allow
		to turn off hyphenation with an undef value as that
		makes it act as a read accessor. Now you can
		pass an explicit 0.
	* IMPROVEMENT: split ວ => ʋ/w depending on position in IPA
	* IMPROVEMENT: small documentation enhancements

v0.1.1	2016-12-04
